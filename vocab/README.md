# Extract Vocab #

This is extracted from a full vocabulary.

It is the actual codes that synthea is using and no more.

There are only about 250 concepts and 15k concept_relationships used by synthea so we can use this small extract for conversion.

This will change over time as synthea evolves to use more codes.

When creating your real omop database you should load the full vocabulary but this subset is ok for conversion.
